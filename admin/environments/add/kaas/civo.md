### A note about Civo versions

Civo clusters using Kubernetes version 1.27 or above on a node size of Extra Small may fail to complete provisioning as the compute resources are too limited for required workloads. Versions prior to 1.27 do not have this resource requirement, so can be used with the Extra Small node size.

You can also expand the **More settings** section and set groups and tags for your environment now or you can do this later.

Once you have made your selections, click **Provision environment** to begin the provision. If you have other environments to configure click **Next** to proceed, otherwise click **Close** to return to the list of environments where you will see the progress of your provision.
