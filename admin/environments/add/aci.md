# Add an ACI environment

Before connecting to your Azure subscription, you need to create an Azure AD application. For more information on this please refer to the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

The following ACI features are not currently supported:

To add an ACI environment, from the menu expand **Environment-related**, click **Environments**, then click **Add environment**.

Select **ACI** as your environment type and click **Start Wizard**. Enter the **environment details** using the table below as a guide.

As an optional step you can expand the **More settings** section and categorize the environment by adding it to a [group](../groups.md) or [tagging](../tags.md) it for better searchability.
