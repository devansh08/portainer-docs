# Notifications

The Notifications section contains a record of all the notification messages you have received in Portainer (the popup messages that appear in the top right of the interface). You can search through past notifications as well as remove specific notification records from the list.

{% hint style="info" %}
The 50 most recent notifications are also accessible by clicking the bell icon in the top right of any page in the Portainer UI.
{% endhint %}
