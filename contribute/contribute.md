## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, please tell us so we can triage it. All bugs are managed in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=bug%2Fneed-confirmation%2C+kind%2Fbug\&template=Bug\_report.md\&title=). When you click through, our template makes it easy to record all of the details. Before you report a bug, please check our list of [open bugs](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/labels/kind%2Fbug) in case someone else has already reported it.

[This knowledge base article](https://portal.portainer.io/knowledge/how-do-you-decide-which-bugs-and-features-to-work-on-first) covers how we prioritize bug fixes.

## Feature requests

You can request new features by posting an Idea in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/portainer/discussions/categories/ideas) forum. Please check to see if someone has already requested the feature you want, and give it an upvote if so.
