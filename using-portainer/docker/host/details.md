This page provides information about the Docker host for the selected environment. The page is split into the following sections: Host Details, Engine Details, and (if enabled) PCI Devices and Physical Disks.

## Host Details

This section describes the host's basic configuration, including the hostname, OS information, kernel version, total CPU and memory. If the environment has the Portainer Agent installed, [host management features](setup.md#enable-host-management-features) are enabled, and a `/host` mount has been configured, you can also browse the host file system from here.&#x20;
