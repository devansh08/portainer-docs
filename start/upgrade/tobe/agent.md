# Upgrading Agent-only deployments

Both Portainer Community Edition and Portainer Business Edition use the same Portainer Agent container image to run, so if you are upgrading from CE to BE and have Agent-only environments, you don't need to upgrade them as well - just ensure they are on the same version (for example, if the Portainer Server is version 2.21.0 then the Portainer Agent should be 2.21.0 as well).
