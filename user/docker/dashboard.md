# Dashboard

The Docker/Swarm dashboard summarizes your Docker Standalone or Docker Swarm environment and shows the components that make up the environment.&#x20;

## Environment info

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is visible only to Docker Standalone environments.
{% endhint %}

This section shows the environment name, its URL and port along with any [tags](../../admin/environments/tags.md#tagging-an-environment). You can also see the number of CPU cores (and their available memory), the Docker version, and whether or not the Portainer Agent is installed.&#x20;
