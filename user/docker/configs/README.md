# Configs

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Configs** menu is only available to Docker Swarm environments.
{% endhint %}

Docker 17.06 introduced swarm service configs which allow you to store non-sensitive information, such as configuration files, outside a serviceâ€™s image or running containers. This allows you to keep your images as generic as possible, without the need to bind-mount configuration files into the containers or use environment variables. [Secrets](../secrets/) is another option for storing sensitive information.

In Portainer you can add and remove custom configurations for use in deployments.
