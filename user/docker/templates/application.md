# Application

An application template lets you deploy a container (or a stack of containers) to an environment with a set of predetermined configuration values while still allowing you to customize the configuration (for example, environment variables). This page lists the application templates available to deploy on your environment.

Portainer supports templates of both individual containers and stacks of containers.

{% content-ref url="deploy-stack.md" %}
[deploy-stack.md](deploy-stack.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="deploy-container.md" %}
[deploy-container.md](deploy-container.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

By default, Portainer provides a pre-built set of app templates, but you are free to modify or [replace these with your own](../../../advanced/app-templates/build.md). You can also create your own custom templates either manually or from an existing stack.
