## Application settings

In this section you can enable or disable front-end data caching for your Kubernetes environments. When this this option is enabled, Portainer will cache data provided about your Kubernetes cluster in the front-end in order to improve load times when viewing the cluster. This caching can however mean that you may not see fully up-to-date information, and changes made by other users or outside of Portainer may take up to five minutes to update in your session.
