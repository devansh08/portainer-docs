# Switching to Portainer Business Edition

It’s easy and quick to upgrade from Portainer CE (both 1.x and 2.x branches) to Portainer Business Edition without losing your data. The following instructions apply whether you’re using a 5 node free license or you’ve purchased a license for Portainer Business Edition.

From version 2.17, you can upgrade your Portainer CE installation to Portainer BE from within Portainer itself.

[inapp.md](inapp.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you would like to upgrade manually, you can find instructions for your environment at the following links:

{% content-ref url="docker.md" %}
[docker.md](docker.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="swarm.md" %}
[swarm.md](swarm.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="kubernetes.md" %}
[kubernetes.md](kubernetes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For Agent-only deployments, you do not need to upgrade the Agent to Business Edition.

{% content-ref url="agent.md" %}
[agent.md](agent.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
